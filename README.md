About us
We live for coffee, pet videos, and celebrations! What started in 1950 as a single Florida bridal salon has grown into an international destination for weddings, proms, quinceañeras, and more. We know a bit about making dreams come true—one in three brides in the U.S. purchases her dress from us—and we can’t wait to help you get ready for the big event, party, gala, shindig, or soirée.

THE DAVID’S DIFFERENCE

Our story began when our founder, Jane, was struggling to find a comfortable mattress for her own home. Frustrated with the lack of options and high prices on the market, she decided to take matters into her own hands and started doing research on the best materials and construction techniques for mattresses.

After months of experimentation and testing, Jane finally found the perfect combination of comfort and affordability. She knew she had to share this discovery with others, and so Better Living Home was born.

We pride ourselves on offering only the best products at fair prices, and we stand behind each and every item we sell. Our mattresses are made with high-density foam for maximum support and comfort, and our toiletries and kitchen accessories are carefully selected for their quality and functionality.

We understand the importance of a good night's sleep and a comfortable home, that's why we are dedicated to providing you with the best products and services.

Thank you for choosing Bridal.com. We hope that our products will help you create a warm and welcoming space that you'll love.
